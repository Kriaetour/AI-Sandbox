- **Global Clock**: Hierarchical time tracking (minutes‚Üíhours‚Üídays‚Üíseasons‚Üíyears)

### Population Balance System
Revolutionary population management preventing explosive growth:

    'REPRO_FOOD_MIN': 2.5,            # Increased from 1.6 (56% increase)
    'LOW_POP_REPRO_MULT': 1.3,        # Reduced from 1.5 (safer boost)
}

RESOURCE_BALANCE = {
    'REGEN_FACTOR': 0.05,             # Reduced from 25.0 (99.8% reduction)
    'CAP_FACTOR': 5.0,                # Reduced from 10.0 (50% reduction)
    'HARVEST_RATE': 0.01-0.05,        # Limited to 1-5% per tick
}
```

### Population Wave System
Advanced sinusoidal cycle system for natural population variation:

    'fertility_period': 400,          # Ticks per fertility cycle
    'mortality_period': 360,          # Ticks per mortality cycle  
    'phase_offset': 1.5708,           # 90¬∞ phase offset between waves
    'fertility_amplitude': 0.15,      # ¬±15% fertility variation
    'mortality_amplitude': 0.10,      # ¬±10% mortality variation
