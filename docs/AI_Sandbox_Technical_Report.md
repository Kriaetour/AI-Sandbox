# AI Sandbox Technical Report

## Project Overview

**AI Sandbox** is a sophisticated autonomous world simulation system written in Python, designed to create emergent behaviors and narratives through procedurally generated environments and AI-### 13. Global Clock System
```python
# Time Tracking Features and Key Methods
- Centralized time management with minute-level precision (world_tick, total_minutes)
- Hierarchical time units: minutes → hours → days → seasons → years (get_current_time)
- Time-of-day calculations for day/night cycles (get_time_of_day, is_daytime)
- Seasonal progression with 4 seasons per year (get_season, season_names)
- Foundation for time-based events and scheduling (get_current_time_string)
```

#### Time Unit Structure
- **1 world_tick()** = 1 minute of in-game time
- **60 minutes** = 1 hour
- **24 hours** = 1 day
- **90 days** = 1 season (4 seasons per year)
- **360 days** = 1 year

#### Clock Implementation
- **Automatic Progression**: Clock increments automatically with each simulation tick
- **Persistent Tracking**: Time continues across simulation sessions
- **Query Methods**: Multiple ways to access current time information
- **Event Foundation**: Basis for scheduling future time-based events and behaviors

### 14. Seasonal Resource System
```python
# Season-Affected Resource Generation
- Terrain-based resource production with seasonal modifiers (distribute_resources)
- Four seasons with different resource multipliers (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)
- Sustainable resource gathering by factions (gather_resources)
- Economic pressure on tribes during harsh seasons (_get_base_resources_for_terrain)
```

#### Seasonal Multipliers
- **Spring**: Plant ×1.2, Animal ×1.0, Mineral ×1.0, Fish ×1.1 (Growth season)
- **Summer**: Plant ×1.5, Animal ×1.3, Mineral ×1.0, Fish ×1.2 (Abundant season)
- **Autumn**: Plant ×1.1, Animal ×1.2, Mineral ×1.0, Fish ×1.0 (Harvest season)
- **Winter**: Plant ×0.3, Animal ×0.7, Mineral ×1.0, Fish ×0.8 (Scarcity season)

#### Resource Types by Terrain
- **Plant Resources**: Generated by Plains, Forest, Jungle, Valley, Coastal, Island, Oasis
- **Animal Resources**: Generated by most terrains, highest in Savanna and Jungle
- **Mineral Resources**: Generated by Mountains, Volcanic, Canyon, Badlands
- **Fish Resources**: Generated by Water, Coastal, Island, Swamp

#### Faction Resource Gathering
- **Territory-Based**: Factions gather from chunks they control
- **Sustainable Rate**: 10% of available resources gathered per tick
- **Resource Conversion**: Plants/animals/fish → food, Minerals → ore, Wood → wood
- **Economic Impact**: Seasonal scarcity affects tribal specialization and diplomacy. The project implements a comprehensive ecosystem where NPCs (Non-Player Characters) interact socially, form tribal societies, engage in diplomacy, and participate in economic activities within a persistent, virtually infinite world.

**Current Version**: Development Build (September 2025)  
**Language**: Python 3.8+  
**Architecture**: Modular, Object-Oriented Design  
**Key Technologies**: Procedural Generation, AI Simulation, Persistence Layer

## Core Architecture

### World Engine System
The foundation of the AI Sandbox is a sophisticated **chunk-based world engine** that manages a virtually infinite 2D grid world:

- **Chunk Management**: World divided into 16x16 coordinate chunks loaded on-demand
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only active chunks remain in memory; inactive chunks are serialized to disk
- **Deterministic Generation**: All world features generated from a single master seed using Perlin noise
- **Persistence Layer**: Modified chunks automatically saved to JSON files in `persistence/chunks/`
- **Terrain System**: Multi-biome world with coherent continents, coastlines, and natural features

### NPC (Non-Player Character) System
The NPC system provides the autonomous agents that drive simulation behavior:

- **Deterministic Generation**: NPCs spawned based on world seed and chunk coordinates
- **State Persistence**: NPC states saved with their parent chunks
- **Social Interaction**: NPCs can engage in dialogue and social behaviors
- **Faction Affiliation**: NPCs belong to factions and participate in group activities
- **Movement AI**: Basic pathfinding and destination-driven movement

### Tribal System
A complex social organization layer built on top of the NPC system:

- **Tribal Structure**: Tribes with hierarchical roles (Leader, Shaman, Warrior, etc.)
- **Cultural Development**: Dynamic cultural quirks, music styles, totems, and spiritual beliefs
- **Economic Specialization**: Tribes specialize in fishing, farming, gathering, or other activities
- **Diplomatic Relations**: Trust-based relationships between tribes
- **Trade Networks**: Inter-tribal economic exchanges
- **Population Management**: Birth/death cycles with recruitment and spawning systems

### Faction System
The faction system manages group-level organization and territory:

- **Territory Claims**: Factions can claim and expand territory chunks
- **Membership Management**: NPCs join and leave factions dynamically
- **Resource Management**: Factions track resources and population capacity
- **Conflict Resolution**: Territory disputes and diplomatic interactions
