## Core Architecture

### World Engine System
The foundation manages a virtually infinite 2D grid world with balanced resource economics and now cultural evolution:

- **Chunk Management**: 16x16 coordinate chunks with deterministic generation
- **Conservative Resource Generation**: REGEN_FACTOR=0.05, CAP_FACTOR=5.0 (previously 25.0/10.0)
- **Seasonal Multipliers**: Balanced resource variation with population wave integration
- **Cultural Geography**: Environment influences cultural development (coastal vs mountain tribes)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only active chunks in memory; inactive chunks serialized to disk
- **Global Clock**: Hierarchical time tracking (minutes‚Üíhours‚Üídays‚Üíseasons‚Üíyears)

### Population Balance System
Revolutionary population management preventing explosive growth:

```python
# Conservative Balance Parameters (Tested for 5000+ ticks)
REPRODUCTION_PARAMS = {
    'REPRO_BASE_CHANCE': 0.03,        # Reduced from 0.07 (57% reduction)
    'REPRO_COOLDOWN': 200,            # Increased from 140 (43% increase)
    'REPRO_FOOD_MIN': 2.5,            # Increased from 1.6 (56% increase)
    'LOW_POP_REPRO_MULT': 1.3,        # Reduced from 1.5 (safer boost)
}

RESOURCE_BALANCE = {
    'REGEN_FACTOR': 0.05,             # Reduced from 25.0 (99.8% reduction)
    'CAP_FACTOR': 5.0,                # Reduced from 10.0 (50% reduction)
    'HARVEST_RATE': 0.01-0.05,        # Limited to 1-5% per tick
}
```

}
```

### Individual NPC Ambition System

    'exploration': 0.15,               # Discover new territories
    'social_status': 0.2,              # Achieve social roles and status
    'alliance_building': 0.2,          # Form strategic relationships
}

AMBITION_PARAMS = {
    'development_chance': 0.1,         # 10% chance per update to develop ambition
    'progress_rate': 0.01,             # Base progress increment
    'conflict_chance': 0.3,            # Chance for ambition conflicts
    'completion_threshold': 1.0,       # Progress needed for ambition completion
