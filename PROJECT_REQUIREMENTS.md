# AI Sandbox Project Requirements

## Project Overview
**AI Sandbox** is an autonomous, procedurally generated world simulation system written in Python that creates emergent behaviors and narratives through AI-driven NPCs forming tribal societies, engaging in diplomacy, and developing complex social dynamics over time.

## Core Objectives
1. **Emergent Narrative Generation**: Create compelling, unpredictable stories through autonomous AI agents
2. **Societal Simulation**: Model realistic tribal societies with culture, economics, and politics
3. **Scalable World System**: Virtually infinite world with efficient memory management
4. **Research Platform**: Provide tools for studying AI behavior, social dynamics, and emergent systems

## Technical Requirements

### Platform & Dependencies
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Core Dependencies**:
  - `noise`: Procedural terrain generation (Perlin noise)
  - `tqdm`: Progress bars for long-running simulations
  - `matplotlib`: Data visualization and analytics
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Architecture Requirements
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns (world, NPCs, tribes, factions)
- **Object-Oriented**: Well-structured classes with clear responsibilities
- **Persistence Layer**: JSON-based save/load system for world state
- **Performance**: Efficient chunk-based world loading, bounded memory usage
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-like architecture for adding new features

## Functional Requirements

### World Generation System
- **Infinite Chunk-Based World**: 16x16 coordinate chunks loaded on-demand
- **20 Diverse Biomes**: Procedural terrain with coherent geography
- **Deterministic Generation**: Reproducible worlds from seeds
- **Seasonal Dynamics**: Four seasons affecting resource availability
- **Time System**: Hierarchical time tracking (minutes → hours → days → seasons → years)

### NPC & AI System
- **Autonomous Agents**: AI-driven characters with decision-making
- **Terrain Adaptation**: Behavior changes based on biome type
- **Memory Systems**: Personal and faction-level memory influencing decisions
- **Social Interactions**: Context-aware dialogue and relationships

### Tribal Society System
- **Cultural Evolution**: Dynamic traditions, music, totems, spiritual beliefs
- **Role-Based Structure**: Leaders, shamans, warriors, specialized roles
- **Economic Specialization**: Fishing, farming, gathering, trading focus
- **Population Dynamics**: Birth/death cycles, recruitment, migration

### Diplomacy & Social Dynamics
- **Proactive Negotiations**: Tribes initiate diplomacy based on needs
- **Reputation System**: Trust levels evolving through interactions
- **Complex Alliances**: Trade agreements, military alliances, treaties
- **Memory-Driven Behavior**: Historical events influence decisions

### Reinforcement Learning Integration
- **Population Control RL**: Q-learning agents for demographic management
- **Diplomacy RL**: Strategic tribal relationship optimization
- **State Observation**: Rich state features for RL training
- **Action Interfaces**: High-level social actions for RL agents

## Performance Requirements
- **Memory Efficiency**: Bounded memory usage through chunk unloading
- **Simulation Speed**: Support for both real-time and accelerated modes
- **Scalability**: Handle hundreds of NPCs and multiple tribes simultaneously
- **Persistence Performance**: Fast save/load operations

## User Experience Requirements
- **Multiple Run Modes**: Interactive menu, batch processing, continuous simulation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Dual logging system (events + communication)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars and status updates
- **Configuration Options**: Command-line arguments for customization
- **Analytics Output**: Data export for analysis and visualization

## Quality Requirements
- **Code Quality**: Clean, documented, maintainable Python code
- **Testing**: Unit tests for core functionality, integration tests for systems
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, technical reports, inline documentation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Profiling tools and performance metrics

## Success Criteria
1. **Emergent Behaviors**: Demonstrable complex social dynamics and narratives
2. **Stability**: Long-running simulations without crashes or memory leaks
3. **Scalability**: Performance scales with world size and NPC count
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and systems
5. **Research Value**: Useful for studying AI, sociology, and complex systems

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
- **Advanced AI**: More sophisticated decision-making algorithms
- **Combat System**: Military conflicts and resolution mechanics
- **Technology Progression**: Cultural and technological advancement
- **Multi-threading**: Parallel processing for performance
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based visualization and control
- **Multi-agent RL**: Competing RL agents in the same world

## Development Priorities
1. **Core Stability**: Ensure reliable world generation and simulation loop
2. **Tribal Dynamics**: Rich, believable tribal societies and interactions
3. **RL Integration**: Robust reinforcement learning capabilities
4. **Performance**: Optimize for long-running simulations
5. **Documentation**: Complete technical and user documentation
